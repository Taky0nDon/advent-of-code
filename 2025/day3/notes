Must turn on TWO batteries
def sum_bank(bank):
    joltage = sum(b for b in bank if b is on)
    return joltage

Find largest possible joltage any bank can produce
Return the sum.
sum(sum_bank(bank) for bank in banks)

use a min heap of size k to iterate over the input.
the min heap has the property:
    - any parent node is <= to all its children

      look through remaining batteries and compare to min
      if it's larger, pop the min and insert it
